Error Texts

MAIN Issues:

If you click on the cirles choices to fast multiple lines are drawn, i tried to midigate this
by doing limiting to first 4 clicks however this still hasen't changed anything. File Error, 
works if there is no leaderbooard file, however other file errro dosen't come up. Im uncertain when 
that should come up. due to crunch time im not implimenting it. 

Game Loads with empty leaderboard file, so a fresh game!
